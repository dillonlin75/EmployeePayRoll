# EmployeePayRoll
A basic employee payroll that I created. 
Each employee should have:
- Employee ID that consists of 2 letters and 3 digits(i.e. AF101)
- First and Last name
- Their hourly pay
- Tax Rate

Things that can be done is:
1) Display All Employees that are in the list currently
2) Find an employee based on their employee ID
3) Find an employee based on their ID and change some of their stuff
4) Add an employee to the list
5) End program and update the list with all the new info
